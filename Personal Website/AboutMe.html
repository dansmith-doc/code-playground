        <p>
            Formally an Electrical Engineer, i started out with software development as a serious hobby in 2014 with a keen interest in the Raspberry Pi and Arduino platforms, using some C++ I built some small IOT projects for home use.
        </p>
        <p>
            I quickly became hooked and was exploring the path of continuous learning, which i am a big believer in. I made a decision by 2017 that Software Development was my ideal career path to persue due to personal interest and the vast amount of learning paths there is available, knowing that there is always likely something to learn and improve upon.
        </p>
        <p>
            Starting out with "Web Development", which i started to study mid 2018 around a full time job, i took online courses with LinkedIn, Udemy and FreeCodeCamp to get some good exposure to good quality materials for HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I wanted to have a good base knowledge of core "Web Technologies" before i moved on to more advanced topics and languages.
        </p>
        <p>
            By the end of 2018, I took a freelance job working as a team member for a Cryptocurrency Blockchain project, I was responsible for documentation and blogs using the projects CMS (Joomla) Which gave me good insight in working with live websites.
        </p>
        <p>
            During the middle of 2020, I began to refresh HTML, CSS and JavaScript to make sure i was sharp as i possibly could be. Still working full time in a different industry, I felt that i needed to persue more than core JavaScript, so i started to explore other frameworks such as Node.js, React, and Angular.
